Scope:
------
      The aim of this one day workshop is to bring together
      researchers from academia and industry interested in the field
      of formal language definitions and language technologies, with a
      special emphasis on tools developed for or with these language
      definitions. Benefits of such active research fields are, among
      others:

	     - Program analysis, transformation, generation
	     - Formal analysis of language properties
	     - Automatic generation of language processing tools

      Although these benefits are well-known, they are in current
      practices hardly exploited. For example, language definitions
      can be augmented in a manner that not only
      compilers/interpreters can be automatically generated but also
      other tools such as syntax-directed editors, debuggers, partial
      evaluators, test case generators, documentation generators,
      etc.
      Domains of applications that are of interest for this workshop
      are among others:
	     - Language components, modeling languages
	     - Re-engineering, re-factoring
	     - Aspect-oriented programming, adaptive programming
	     - Domain-specific languages
	     - XML processing
	     - Visualization and graph transformation

Invited Talk:
-------------
      Hassan Ait Kaci,
      Distinguished Scientist, Research an Development, ILOG, France.

Tool demonstrations:
--------------------
      The one day LDTA 2003 workshop program will also include a
      session on tool demonstrations.

Submission procedure and publication:
-------------------------------------
      Accepted papers will be published and available during the
      workshop. After revision, final copies of the accepted papers
      will be published in Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer
      Science (ENTCS), Elsevier Science. Author's instructions are
      given here. The authors of the best papers will be invited to
      write a journal version of their paper which will be separately
      reviewed and after acceptance be published in a special issue
      devoted to  LDTA 2003 of the journal Science of Computer
      Programming (Elsevier Science).
