This site's index.html is generated from home.wae, which is a Waebric
script. Waebric can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/waebric/.

To run the script and generate the html type the following:
  ./waebric home.wae >index.html

This site's css is a creative commons public domain css, slightly adapted by me to include the LDTA top logo and to remove the dog paws that were a topic in this css.

The directories 20[0-9][0-9] contain copies of most of the old LDTA 
online announcements. Some could not be recovered, so I've included their
call for papers instead, as retrieved from an arbitrary mailing list archive.

Cheers,
